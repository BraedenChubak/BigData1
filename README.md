## Confirmed
The median confirmed cases of COVID-19 for a country is only 5059, compared to the mean of 88,130 cases.  When also taking into account the maximum of 4,290,259 cases, this means that only a few countries likely make up a large majority of COVID-19 cases.

## Deaths
Similarly to the confirmed cases, the median COVID-19 deaths is only 108, compared to the mean of 3497 and the maximum of 148,011.  This means that the deaths follow a similar trend to confirmed cases.

## New Cases
Many countries only have new cases in the single digits, while others have as high as 56,336 new COVID cases.  This difference could show a difference in the effectiveness of each nation's strategy to mitigating new cases

## New Deaths
When it comes to new deaths, a large majority of countries only have single-digit new deaths, while some have as high as 1076.  This is similar to new cases, where it may show a difference in treatment effectiveness, but in this case, it may moreso show treatment ineffictiveness of the high-death nations.

## Deaths / 100 Recovered
Most countries have low rates of death compared to recovery, but the fact that any nation could have over 30 times the deaths as recoveries is mind-boggling.
